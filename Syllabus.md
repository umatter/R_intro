# Prerequisites

- Install the latest R version. R is open source and freely available from here: https://stat.ethz.ch/CRAN/. Click on the respective link for your operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux), and follow the instructions.
- Once R is installed, install RStudio from here: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download. Under "Installers for Supported Platforms", click on the respective installer for your operating system (Windows, Mac, etc.) and follow the instructions.
- In case you have problems with the installations, you can create a free account for [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/): https://rstudio.cloud/, and use the R/RStudio in the cloud for this course. Note, however, that it is strongly recommended to also have R/RStudio running on your own machine.


# Course Content

## Short summary
This course introduces students to the fundamental practices of programming with R in the context of economic research. The course briefly covers basic theoretical concepts and teaches basic skills in how to mJSe use of the high-level programming language and statistical computing environment [R](https://www.r-project.org/). Examples and exercises are focused on data handling and data analysis tasks. The overall aim is to give students a solid overview of basic programming in R, and how they can potentially mJSe use of R during their studies and research in economics.


# Course Structure
This is a block course and part of the introductory week for MEcon students at HSG. The course is structured in three parts:

## Part I: Background/Tools

 - Why R? Why programming?
 - The tools: R, RStudio.

## Part II: First steps in R, core concepts.

 - First steps in R: R as a calculator, variables.
 - Basic programming concepts in R.
 - R objects and data structures.
 - R functions for basic statistics.

### Part III: Working with Data in R.

 - Loading/importing data.
 - Visualizing data with R/ggplot.
 - Basic data analysis with R.
